#### Idea

Iterate through a massive comparing 2 neighbour elements each time. If previous element is greater than following, swap them and continue.

This process allow to "bubble up" and to
*__correctly__* place the greatest element on each iteration.

#### Data Structures

- Array

#### Complexity

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th colspan=2>Time</th>
            <th rowspan=2>Space</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Average</td>
            <td>Worst</td>
            <td rowspan=2>
                O(1)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>O(n^2)</td>
            <td>O(n^2)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
